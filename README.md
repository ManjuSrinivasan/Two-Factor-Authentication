# Two-Factor-Authentication

* Two-factor authentication (2FA) to verify user identity has become increasingly popular, as internet security breaches and fraud claims rise. 
* Adding the extra layer of 2FA security makes your apps not only more reliable but also more trustworthy to your users.
* OTPs generated via software and hardware token are usually referred as TOTP (Time-Based OTP).
* Hardware tokens work in a similar way to software token, the difference being that you have a dedicated piece of hardware solely responsible for generating tokens.
